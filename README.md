# Path of Web Tools
Chrome extension that provides some basic, niche functionality to Path of Exile community sites.

Tee goal of this extension is to provide functionality that I consider basic and needed on various community sites for Path of Exile. This will come as I encounter functionality deficits. I hope at some point these issues are resolved cleanly by the sites themselves, but until then, I want to save some annoyance and repitition.

# How to Use
This is a developer mode Chrome extension. Enable developer mode for extensions and simply browse to the root directory of this project. Chrome should load the extension automatically and without issue.

# Current Functionality
## poe.trade Path of Building item copy
When on the poe.trade website with a page of results, clicking on the extension icon button will add a "PoB" link next to the "whisper" link. Clicking the "PoB" link will copy needed information to the clipboard so that it can be pasted into Path of Building quickly and free of typos.

### Feature Specific Issues
- Clicking the "PoB" link multiple times will generate multiple links for the same item

# Issues
- Extension permissions may not be correct (may be too broad?)
- Extension does not work automatically
- Icon used for extension may not be public domain
